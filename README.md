# Stock Forecasting Tool üìà

Welcome to the **Stock Forecasting Tool**! This project allows users to fetch stock data, visualize historical stock prices, and generate simple price forecasts using a linear regression model.

## Features ‚ú®
- Fetch stock data for various companies using Yahoo Finance API.
- Visualize the stock's historical prices along with a simple forecast.
- Selectable time periods for fetching stock data (e.g., 1 week, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years).
- Dynamic resizing of charts based on the window size.
- Error handling for invalid stock symbols or missing data.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python** ‚Äì The primary programming language.
- **CustomTkinter** ‚Äì A modern and beautiful GUI framework built on Tkinter.
- **yfinance** ‚Äì A popular library for accessing financial data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Matplotlib** ‚Äì Used for plotting the historical stock prices and forecast.
- **Statsmodels** ‚Äì Used for statistical modeling to generate stock price forecasts.

## Requirements üìã
To run this project locally, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
- `pip install customtkinter yfinance matplotlib statsmodels pandas numpy`

## How to Use the Tool üñ•Ô∏è
Clone the repository:
- `git clone https://github.com/Cozmescu-Daniel/StockPrediction.git`

Navigate to the project directory:
- `cd StockPrediction`

Run the main.py script to launch the application:
- `python main.py`

The tool will display a GUI window where you can:
  
- Select a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT).
- Choose the time period for which you want to fetch data (1W, 6M, 1Y, 5Y).
- View a graph with actual stock prices and predicted prices for the next 7 days.

## Example üñºÔ∏è
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30160b56-afdf-47cd-a386-f79d169b8150)
The graph will show:

- The actual historical stock prices.
- A forecast of the stock's price for the next 7 days.

## How the Forecast Works üìä
The forecast is generated using a simple Linear Regression model:

- Historical stock data is used to create a linear regression model.
- The model then predicts future stock prices based on the historical trend.
- The next 7 days' forecasted prices are shown in red as dashed lines.

## Customization ‚úçÔ∏è
- Add more stocks: The sample stock list can be customized to include more symbols. Update the sample_stock_list variable.
- Change forecast model: You can replace the linear regression model with a more advanced forecasting model if desired.
- Modify the time periods: You can add more time periods (e.g., 1 month) by updating the set_time_period function.
